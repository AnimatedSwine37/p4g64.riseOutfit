Also on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/527868)!

A mod for P4G 64-Bit that lets you change the outfit Rise is wearing when she assists the party in battle. Outfits are acquired through natural gameplay and equipped in the equipment menu like other party members.

## Available Outfits
The mod contains the following outfits for Rise:
- Summer Yaso Outfit - Unlocked in summer
- Summer Clothes - Unlocked in summer
- Winter Yaso Outfit - Unlocked in winter
- Winter Clothes - Unlocked in winter
- Midwinter Yaso Outfit - Unlocked in winter
- Midwinter Clothes - Unlocked in winter
- Floral Bikini - Purchased at Croco Fur
- Festival Yukata - Purchased at Croco Fur as a part of the Festival Set
- Gekkou Uniform - Included with the girls' uniforms given by Kashiwagi after getting the top grade in the December exam
- Bath Towel - Unlocked after the hot springs trip
- Cook's Apron - Unlocked after reaching rank 10 in Rise's Social Link
- Ski Wear - Unlocked after the ski trip
- Revealing Swimsuit - Unlocked after defeating the bonus boss in Marukyu Striptease
- Midsummer Clothes - Unlocked in NG+ after getting the golden ending for the game

Note that outfits will be automatically given to you if you have already met their unlock criteria so it doesn't matter what point in your playthrough you enable this mod.

## Other Equipment
As I unlocked the equipment menu for Rise you can now equip Weapons, Armor, and Accessories on her. Note that these have no effect on anything, they are just available as a side effect of being able to equip outfits in the menu.

The default armor (Lace Camisole) and accessory (Ribbon) were already in the game but the weapon (Bare Hand) is something I added.
